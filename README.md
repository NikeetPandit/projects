# Projects 

Each project file includes software, documentation, and a theoretical treatment except "Geomagnetic Storm Influence on Swarm Space Mission". The lossy image compression and Fourier and Least-Squares Wavelet REPORT with testing and theory will be uploaded after I have completed/submitted by Masters thesis and submitted for my journal submission since there is some overlap.
